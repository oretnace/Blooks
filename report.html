					<h1>
						Report
					</h1>
					
					<p>
						This website was written by Arnold Cantero using Notepad++ with 
						Chrome browser for visual testing.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The following list items were notes I recorded as I was building this website.
						Please pardon theinformality and improper spelling and grammar at times, I 
						wanted to get ideas and thoughts down as quick as possible. Hopefully you can make
						sense of what I have written.
					</p>
					
					<h3>
						BEWARE - MUST HAVEs
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Code must not be changed for website to work,
							otherwise syntax errors etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							Locations of all files must not be moved.
						</li>
						<li>
							All pages need in header:
							<ul>
								<li>meta name viewport</li>
								<li>main css file link</li>
								<li>sidebar javascript link</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Content column must be longer than sidebar - but don't worry, 
							this is already written in the CSS.
						</li>
						<li>
							Need to make sure inputs in form have name if i want to pass 
							them
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						CHOICES MADE
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Purpose of the site is to sell books related to the colour 
							blue, just from the idea of wordplay: blue + books. Also because 
							blue is a calm, soothing colour and a personal preference.
						</li>
						<li>
							Written on the go using Notedpad++ and Chrome browser, with the 
							aid of previous lab work and w3schools tutorials. Not sure of any 
							other methods to write the website from scratch, I'd be wasting 
							time if I spent time to research alternative software.
						</li>
						<li>
							Single CSS file as all pages share the same layout and themes. 
							There would be too many files if each page had their own CSS file.
						</li>
						<li>
							Entity name used for copyright (Footer) and arrows symbol 
							(Slide show), just to give it a try. It might be fun.
						</li>
							Rounded corners at top of header, bottom of footer, hovers, catalog 
							table, slide show to make the site look smoother.
						<li>
							XML Page is renamed 'Catalog', and Order Forms to 'Order Books' 
							so it's easier to understand for the user.
						</li>
							In Catalog and Slide show pages, XML is displayed through the HTML 
							output from JavaScript using a for loop through all books in the XML file.
						<li>
							In Order Form, method = "post" should be used to protect sensitive data.
						</li>
							Required fields are orange as it complements the site's blue colour 
							scheme, grabs user's attention.
						<li>
							When selecting country in order form, i didn't want to include the entire 
							list of all countries so i gave user the option to type theirs in.
						</li>
						<li>
							More white space in background in print-friendly version to save ink. Borders.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						PAST CHOICES
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							HTML5 semantic tags used: 
							<ul>
								<li>
									&#60;header&#62;
								</li>
								<li>
									&#60;nav&#62;
								</li>
								<li>
									&#60;main&#62; - for page content
								</li>
								<li>
									&#60;aside&#62; - sidebar
								</li>
								<li>
									&#60;footer&#62;
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						CHANGES MADE FROM ORIGINAL PLAN
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Site logo is now an image instead of text. Before, it was a header image under
text in &#60;header&#62; which had a modified fill and outline colour in CSS.
						</li>
						<li>
							XML Book data titles are sorted alphabetically - done it manually, not a result of code.
So it's easier to find a book by title. I originally wanted the file to allow new books to be
appended without having to be in order.
						</li>
						<li>
							Moved JavaScript in some pages from HTML file to a separate .js document: Catalog, Slide show.
Script was in HTML code but it looked too long so I separated it.
						</li>
						<li>
							In slide show, added a scroll when text would overflow caption box so all information is retained.
						</li>
						<li>
							Inactive thumbnails stay transparent, active thumbnail turns opaque, lets you know which
thumbnail you're looking at.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added whitespace: nowrap to keep two-word nav link names together in smaller screen sizes. The screen width limit has been changed so we don't risk seeing this happening, mobile
	version screen width limit has been increased.
						</li>
						<li>
							In order form, used &#60;label&#62; tag as I didn't like the appearnce of the text cursor when the cursor
hovered over the text box names.
						</li>
						<li>
							XML/Catalog page no longer uses a table to display books as I want the layout to change when the site is in mobile view. When in mobile view, the table would have a fixed width and the contents inside the 
table wouldn't fit and go off the screen. Instead, they are now in divs so that information next to the
book cover moves below it.
						</li>
						<li>
							In form, took out the label tags next to the input texts and used the placeholder attribute instead.
Less code for me to write and looks neater in HTML file.
						</li>
						<li>
							Took out required attribute in form, javascript now displays hidden sections depending on selections and
makes them required.
						</li>
						<li>
							Took out card billing address details, too much information
						</li>
						
						
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						CHALLENGES DURING DEVELOPMENT
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Padding and layout of elements in navigation bar. I just needed to figure out which element I
was selecting: &#60;ul&#62;, &#60;li&#62; or &#60;a&#62;.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finding specific books to suit the site's purpose then converting the information to
XML was a bit lengthy and time consuming.
						</li>
						<li>
							Struggling to make the right &#60;aside&#62; column fill any gaps and stretch down to the footer.
						</li>
						<li>
							I wasted so much time trying to make a really fancy slide show with JavaScript terms I've
never come across before from an example in w3schools when I can use a simpler example from the labs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Writing the JavaScript for the slideshow was a little challenging, I needed to count the number of
books and was struggling trying to access variables with a local scope.
						</li>
						<li>
							In order form, Difficulty in trying to get value of selected option from drop down list, wanted to compare it
against a value in javascript.
						</li>
						<li>
							Centering elements was a massive pain.
						</li>
						<li>
							In javascript functions, wanted to make code neater by having variable declarations outside of code as the same
variables would be used in other variables. However, the triggering event triggers different functions and the declarations
arent in the functions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Form doesn't submit how i want to when trying to validate postcode with javascript so used html pattern instead
						</li>
						<li>
							Selecting the right elements in the form with javascript
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						SUCCESSES
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Feeling satisfied for incorporating aesthetic improvements like box shadows, hover transitions and
slide show thumbnails, looks nicer. Especially how you can select a thumbnail and the active thumbnail stays opaque.
						</li>
						<li>
							When testing on other browsers like Firefox, it was a good thing I used entity names as the £ sign didn't display
correctly. But it then displayed correctly when I changed it to the entity name in the HTML code.
						</li>
						<li>
							I have struggled to make the sidebar stretch all the way down to be as long as the content box
so I re-wrote the HTML code of the main page layout. The more I messed around with the CSS, the more I got
IDs, classes and HTML5 semantic tags confused. Some CSS stylings would work on some elements, using semantic
tags actually made styling more confusing for me so I went back to basics and used divs instead.
This time around, I successfully made the layout responsive and used less absolute measurements like px. The website now
shifts to a mobile view at screen sizes of 500px and less. The page contents are then listed vertically:
the navigation links, the content followed by the sidebar, then the footer. I did this by wrapping the content and
sidebar divs with another div with overflow auto and had the same background colour as the sidebar to create the illusion.
The result was a success after testing the browser window sizes with IE v11, Firefox v50 and Chrome v55.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In Catalog, sort items so that book data can be appended to the XML file that aren't in order.
						</li>
						<li>
							I'd like the thumbnails in the slide show to be centralised.
						</li>
						<li>
							Option to increase quantity of one kind of book in order form
						</li>
						<li>
							Improve aesthetics of order form
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>
						POSSIBLE ISSUES
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Webkit needed for hover transitions so it shows on other browsers?
						</li>
						<li>
							Although pages load in less than a few seconds, during this loading page, the layout can briefly
look disjointed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Want to use E-Mail and datalist input type in the order form even though it doesn't work on Safari. However,
after reading up online on finding a way to validate an email input, it was suggested not to use a pattern for this.
Instead, to use the email input type.
						</li>
						<li>
							Postcode and phone number only accepts UK system
						</li>
						<li>
							Phone number is optional, form validation for this field may be pointless
						</li>
						<li>
							Order form total did work, totaled the delivery price + books, I promise you it did. But I fiddled with the code very
							last minute near the deadline and it stopped working.
						</li>
						<li>
							As I have struggled to select form elements with javascript, the basket in the order form is supposed to
							show which books the user has chosen.

	- EDIT: The screen width limit has been changed so we don't risk seeing this happening, mobile
	version screen width limit has been increased.
- In order form, used <label> tag as I didn't like the appearnce of the text cursor when the cursor
hovered over the text box names.
- A button will be used in the order form to progress to next sections.
- XML/Catalog page no longer uses a table to display books as I want the layout to change when the site
is in mobile view. When in mobile view, the table would have a fixed width and the contents inside the 
table wouldn't fit and go off the screen. Instead, they are now in divs so that information next to the

CHALLENGES DURING DEVELOPMENT:
- Padding and layout of elements in navigation bar. I just needed to figure out which element I
was selecting: <ul>, <li> or <a>.
- Finding specific books to suit the site's purpose then converting the information to
XML was a bit lengthy and time consuming.
- Struggling to make the right <aside> column fill any gaps and stretch down to the footer.
- I wasted so much time trying to make a really fancy slide show with JavaScript terms I've
never come across before from an example in w3schools when I can use a simpler example from the labs.
- Writing the JavaScript for the slideshow was a little challenging, I needed to count the number of
books and was struggling trying to access variables with a local scope.
- Wanted to use new HTML input types but some browsers don't support some types.
All allowed in IE, Firefox and Chrome:
		- button, checkbox, color, email, file, hidden, image, number, password, radio, range, reset
		- search, submit, text, url
- In order form, Difficulty in trying to get value of selected option from drop down list, wanted to compare it
against a value in javascript.
- Centering elements was a massive pain.
- In javascript functions, wanted to make code neater by having variable declarations outside of code as the same

IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE:
- In Catalog, sort items so that book data can be appended to the XML file that aren't in order.
- I'd like the thumbnails in the slide show to be centralised.

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
- Webkit for hover transitions so it shows on other browsers?
	- <nav> bar
	- slideshow buttons
	- thumbnails
- Although pages load in less than a few seconds, during this loading page, the layout can briefly
look disjointed.
- Want to use E-Mail and datalist input type in the order form even though it doesn't work on Safari. However,
after reading up online on finding a way to validate an email input, it was suggested not to use a pattern for this.
Instead, to use the email input type.
	- Email alternative: manually write code myself to validate email input.
	- Datalist alternative: dropdown of countries with 'Other' option, triggering a text box.
- Slide show in IE and Firefox doesn't start with the first book, starts empty.
- Postcode and phone number only accepts UK system
- Phone number is optional, form validation for this field may be pointless

TRY:
- Print friendly
- Maybe find a way to sort XML data with code?
- Make catalog table single column for responsiveness in mobile view
